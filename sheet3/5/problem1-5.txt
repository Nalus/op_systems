Problem 1.5
What i found in my research of real-world malloc implementations is that they
all use some kind of sectioning for their data storage.
What this means is that they have an array of buckets, one for each sections.

They look exactly like age ranges on most of question forms:
0-11, 12-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41,50, 51-60, 61+

Of course these are multiplied by memory factors. Some implementations only
bother to differentiate between two sizes (>=256 b and <256 b).
